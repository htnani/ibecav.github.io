title: Announcing CGPfunctions 0.3 -- April 20, 2018
tags: R ggplot2 functions dplyr ANOVA CRAN
---

As I continue to learn and grow in using R I have been trying to develop
the habit of being more formal in documenting and maintaining the
various functions and pieces of code I write. It’s not that I think they
are major inventions but they are useful and I like having them stored
in one place that I can keep track of. So I started building them as a
package and even publishing them to CRAN. For any of you who might find
them of interest as well.

[![CRAN
Version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/CGPfunctions)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CGPfunctions)

## Overview

A package that includes functions that I find useful for teaching
statistics as well as actually practicing the art. They typically are
not “new” methods but rather wrappers around either base R or other
packages and concepts I’m trying to master. Currently contains:

  - `Plot2WayANOVA` which as the name implies conducts a 2 way ANOVA and
    plots the results using `ggplot2`
  - `PlotXTabs` which as the name implies plots cross tabulated
    variables using `ggplot2`
  - `neweta` which is a helper function that appends the results of a
    Type II eta squared calculation onto a classic ANOVA table
  - `Mode` which finds the modal value in a vector of data
  - `SeeDist` which wraps around ggplot2 to provide visualizations of
    univariate data.
  - `OurConf` is a simulation function that helps you learn about
    confidence intervals

## Installation

``` r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("CGPfunctions")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ibecav/CGPfunctions")
```

## Credits

Many thanks to Dani Navarro and the book \> ([Learning Statistics with
R](http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html))
whose etaSquared function was the genesis of `neweta`.
