title: Announcing another slopegraph plotting function -- June 14, 2018
tags: R ggplot2 functions dplyr slopegraph CRAN ggrepel
---

A couple of weeks ago [I wrote a blog post about
slopegraphs](https://ibecav.github.io/slopegraph/). There was some 
polite interest and it was a good chance to practice my [functional
programming skills](https://ibecav.github.io/betterfunctions/) so
I decided to see if I could make a decent R function from what I had 
learned.  It's in pretty good shape so I just pushed an update to
CRAN (it will take awhile to process). You can also get the latest version from GitHub.

[The documentation for it is here](https://ibecav.github.io/CGPfunctions/reference/newggslopegraph.html).  Longer
term I hope [to move it here](https://github.com/leeper/slopegraph).

[![CRAN
Version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/CGPfunctions)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CGPfunctions)

## Overview

The package also includes other functions that I find useful for teaching
statistics as well as actually practicing the art. They typically are
not “new” methods but rather wrappers around either base R or other
packages and concepts I’m trying to master.

  - `Plot2WayANOVA` which as the name implies conducts a 2 way ANOVA and
    plots the results using `ggplot2`
  - `PlotXTabs` which as the name implies plots cross tabulated
    variables using `ggplot2`
  - `neweta` which is a helper function that appends the results of a
    Type II eta squared calculation onto a classic ANOVA table
  - `Mode` which finds the modal value in a vector of data
  - `SeeDist` which wraps around ggplot2 to provide visualizations of
    univariate data.
  - `OurConf` is a simulation function that helps you learn about
    confidence intervals

## Installation

``` r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("CGPfunctions")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ibecav/CGPfunctions")
```

## Credits

Many thanks to Dani Navarro and the book \> ([Learning Statistics with
R](http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html))
whose etaSquared function was the genesis of `neweta`.
